🩺 A1C → eAG Converter</br>
The A1C → eAG Converter is a simple, interactive web tool that helps users translate their A1C percentage (a standard lab test for long-term blood sugar control) into Estimated Average Glucose (eAG) values. The results are shown in both mg/dL and mmol/L, the two common blood glucose units.

✨ Features</br>
Instant Conversion: Enter an A1C value and instantly see the corresponding eAG.
Dual Units: Displays results in mg/dL and mmol/L for international use.
Reference Table: Includes a scrollable reference chart from 4.0% to 10.0% A1C (in 0.1% steps) with auto-highlighting of the closest value.
Auto-Scroll: The table automatically scrolls to center the highlighted A1C row, so users always see their result in context.
Copy to Clipboard: One-click copy of the result for easy sharing or saving.
Educational Tip: Includes a practical lifestyle tip (“Walking 10–15 minutes after meals can help reduce post-meal glucose spikes”).
Mobile-Friendly Design: Built with Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout and clean, modern styling.

🧮 Formula Used</br>
The tool uses the ADA-standardized formula to convert A1C to eAG:
eAG (mg/dL) = (28.7 × A1C) − 46.7 eAG (mg/dL)=(28.7×A1C)−46.7

Then, mg/dL is converted to mmol/L using:
mmol/L = mg/dL 18 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL

🎯 Use Cases</br>
Patients: Quickly interpret your lab A1C results in everyday glucose units.

Clinicians & Educators: Provide a clear visual aid to explain how A1C relates to average blood sugar.

Developers: Lightweight, client-side calculator built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and jQuery — easy to embed in health-related apps or dashboards.
